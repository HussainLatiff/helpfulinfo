templates.json is simply a template with some descriptive comments and field values. <br></br> 
no-flag.json, one-flag.json and two-flags.json are all working examples. Use this for tests and better understand how to use templates.

-   one-flag shows one feature flag that contains a fedgraph with two subgraphs
-   two-flags shows two feature flags, one flg is for a fedgraph one for a monograph
